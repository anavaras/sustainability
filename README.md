# sustainability



To implement the complete workflow for alerting and reducing the carbon footprint of website/apps using Microsoft Sustainability Manager, Azure Function Apps, Azure Database, Azure App Insights, ML apps (if available), React.js, and Monday.com API, we followed the steps outlined below:

Installations:

Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org).
Install Azure CLI: Follow the instructions provided by Microsoft to install the Azure CLI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
Install the Monday.com SDK: Run npm install monday-sdk-js to install the Monday.com SDK.
Install other required dependencies based on your specific needs.
Set up Azure Resources:

Create an Azure account: Sign up for an Azure account if you don't have one already.
Set up Azure Function App: Follow the Azure documentation to create an Azure Function App (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal).
Set up Azure Database: Create an Azure Database (such as Azure SQL Database) to store the carbon footprint data.
Set up Azure App Insights: Create an Azure Application Insights resource to monitor and track your application's performance.
Set up ML apps (if available): Set up any required ML applications or services for analyzing and predicting carbon footprint data.
Build the Azure Function App:

Create a new directory for your Azure Function App.
Initialize a new Node.js project: Run npm init in the project directory and follow the prompts.
Install required dependencies: Run npm install to install the required dependencies such as the Microsoft Sustainability Manager library.
Create the Azure Function code: Write the Azure Function code to retrieve the carbon footprint data, perform calculations, and trigger alerts as needed.
Deploy the Azure Function: Use the Azure CLI or Azure portal to deploy your Azure Function App.
Build the React.js Application:

Create a new directory for your React.js application.
Initialize a new React.js project: Run npx create-react-app . in the project directory to set up a new React.js project.
Install required dependencies: Install any additional dependencies needed for your React.js application, such as Axios for making API calls.
Create the React components: Write the necessary React components for displaying carbon footprint data and handling API calls.
Update the React component with API calls: Update the React component to fetch carbon footprint data from the Azure Function API and display it.
Run the React application: Use npm start to run the React.js application locally.
Integrate with Monday.com API:

Use the provided code examples earlier to integrate with the Monday.com API.
Update the code with your Monday.com API key, board ID, group ID, column IDs, and other necessary information.
Use the createTask function to create new tasks in Monday.com with carbon footprint data.
Use the updateTask function to update existing tasks with new carbon footprint data.
Set up Monitoring and Analytics:

Connect Azure App Insights: Use the Azure portal to connect your Azure Function App and React.js application to Azure App Insights for monitoring and analytics.
Set up logging and metrics: Implement logging and metrics in your Azure Function code and React.js application to track relevant events and performance data.
Test and Deploy:

Test your application locally: Run and test your Azure Function App and React.js application locally to ensure they are working as expected.
Deploy your application: Use the Azure CLI or Azure portal to deploy your Azure Function App and host your React
